### Introduction
The goal of project is to develop a computer science-related application or system that demonstrates our understanding of various concepts covered in the SPM 2023 syllabus. The project is a practical way to showcase our knowledge and skills in computer science and serves as an integral part of our assessment, which is the **Malaysian Certificate of Education 2022/2023** of which I am a participant.

### Project Overview
I built a MacBook online store using XAMPP (Apache Server) with MySQL as the database. The project backend is written in PHP.
For the frontend, I used DaisyUI/Tailwind as frontend UI.

### Installation and Usage
Firstly, install XAMPP on your local machine. Then download the `main` file to your `htdocs` folder. Open XAMPP and start both Apache and MySQL. 

Then, go to [localhost/phpmyadmin](localhost/phpmyadmin) and copy/paste the contents from `_reset.sql` to the SQL command line and execute the command to create the database.


To access the website, open up your browser and go to [localhost/main](localhost/main/index.php)

You should see the login page:
